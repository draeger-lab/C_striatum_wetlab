# CGXII medium preparation

CGXII was prepared according to the [protocol given by Unthan et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25103):

Stock solutions (all prepared in water, by filtering through a 0.22µm filter):
* (NH4)2SO4: 200 g/L -> 20 g/L
* K2HPO4: 100 g/L -> 1 g/L
* KH2PO4: 100 g/L -> 1 g/L
* CaCl2 · 2 H2O: 5.3 g/L -> 0.01325 g/L
* MgSO4 · 7 H2O: 25 g/L -> 0.25 g/L
* FeSO4 · 7 H2O: 1 g/L -> 0.01 g/L
* MnSO4 · H2O: 1 g/L -> 0.01 g/L
* NiCl2 · 6 H2O: 20 mg/L -> 0.02 mg/L
* CuSO4 · 5 H2O: 1 g/L -> 0.313 mg/L
* ZnSO4 · 7 H2O: 100 mg/L -> 1 mg/L
* biotin: 20 mg/L -> 0.2 mg/L
* D-glucose: 100 g/L -> 10 g/L
* Protocateuic acid: 3 g/L -> 30 mg/L
* CoCl2 · 6 H20: 1 g/L -> 0.0024 g/L

Each time the medium was prepared, a new urea stock solution with 200 g/L (final concentration 5 g/L) was prepared.

The final medium was then prepared by mixing the stock solutions to the final concentrations, adding water to fill to the desired volume and adjusting the pH to 7 using a 1M NaOH solution. Afterwards the medium was sterilized by filtering.

Below you can find a table on how to prepare 250 mL of medium.
