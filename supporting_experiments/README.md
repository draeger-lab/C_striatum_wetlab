This folder holds all experimental data, analysis, code and organizational files (like a PDF to denote OD measurements in) that either support the Binary Growth Phenotypes / Growth Kinetics experiments or that provide further insight (OD-CFU measurements).

* `data` holds raw and aggregated laboratory data
* `figures` holds graphs and tables created with the scripts and the data provided in the other folders
