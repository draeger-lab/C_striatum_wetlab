# Protocol for Growth Kinetics

* Choose one colony per strain from plates
* Add colony to 10 ml of TSB
* Leave at 37°C in the shaker at 150 rpm overnight
* Dilute grown strains to 0.05 OD / 0.2 OD into media of interest 
* Fill 96 well plate with 150µl per well using 3 technical replicates per strain and condition
* Use Plate-Reader to determine OD every 15 mins at 600 rpm and 37°C
