# Protocol for Binary Growth Phenotypes

* Choose one colony per strain from plates
* Add colony to 10 ml of TSB
* Leave at 37°C in the shaker at 150 rpm overnight
* Dilute grown strains by adding around 100 muL in 10 ml of TSB
* Leave at 37°C in the shaker for 4.5 to 6.5 hours
* Centrifugate 2 ml at 4000 rcf and 37°C for 10 mins
* Remove liquid and keep pellet
* Repeat centrifugation for larger pellet 
* Resuspend pellet in 1 ml minimal medium
* Measure OD of resuspended pellet
* Start minmal medium overnight with 0.2 OD
* Measure OD at t = 0h
* Measure OD at t = 24h
* Determine fold change
